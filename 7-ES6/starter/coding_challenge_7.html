Suppose that you're working in a small town administration, and you're in charge of two town elements:
    <ol><li><strong>Parks</strong></li><li><strong>Streets</strong></li></ol>

It's a very small town, so right now there are only <strong>3 parks and 4 streets</strong>.  <strong>All parks and streets have a name and a build year.</strong>

At an end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following:
    <ol><li>Tree density of each park in the town (forumla: number of trees/park area)</li><li>Average age of each town's park (forumla: sum of all ages/number of parks)</li><li>The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees</li><li>Total and average length of the town's streets</li><li>Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/huge. If the size is unknown, the default is normal</li></ol>

All the <strong>report data should be printed to the console.</strong>

<p>HINT: Use some of the ES6 features: classes, subclasses, template strings, default parameters, maps, arrow functions, destructuring, etc.</p> </body>
